Developed a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify facial expressions into happy and sad categories.
Implemented effective data preprocessing techniques to enhance the model's performance, including image normalization, resizing, and augmentation.
Utilized appropriate evaluation metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score, to assess the model's performance and ensure robust classification.
